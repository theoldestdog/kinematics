# kinematics
Working out some projectile kinematics

Working out the math and physics behind being able to calculate some of the parameters of projectile flight both
with and w/o drap being a factor.

Each piece of the flight is broken out and the basic calculations made so as to better understand how the coding works
using Numpy principally
